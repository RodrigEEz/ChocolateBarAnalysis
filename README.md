# Chocolate Bar Analysis

The current project aims to discover, through visualization and inferences, which attributes impact more on chocolate bars rating reviewed by the [Flavors of Cacao](http://flavorsofcacao.com/) authors.

## Description

Flavors of Cacao is a website related to the [Manhattan Chocolate Society](http://flavorsofcacao.com/mcs_index.html). It contains useful information and resources about cacao beans, crops, harvesting techniques and so forth. Flavors of Cacao also has databases containing information about cacao craft makers and chocolate bars.

[Chocolate Bar Rating database](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html) contains over 2600 records of plain dark chocolate bars. These bars were tested and subsequently rated by the authors of the webpage. All the labeling and rating method is extensively documented on the same webpage.

What you'll find in this repository is an exploration through the Chocolate Bar Rating database. The goal is to identify and present which elements of the rated chocolate bars might be related to their overall rating.


## Content

In this repository, you will find:

- the Chocolate Bar Rating database, exported in .csv format.
- The exploration process, made in Jupyter Notebook.


## Considerations

- Bars are rated by the authors of the webpage. They are the solely testers and reviewers of every chocolate bar the dataset contains. Their qualification method is explained in detail in the [website](http://flavorsofcacao.com/review_guide.html). 
- Dataset was exported and published by a third-party, not involved in the website nor in this analysis. Dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nyagami/chocolate-bar-ratings-2022).
- This analysis was made for practice and self-educational purposes only. It shouldn't be used as an academic, research or citing resource.
